# 🐍 Python Fundamentals
Welcome to the Python Fundamentals repository!
This project contains examples, exercises, and notes to help beginners understand the core concepts of the Python programming language.

## 💡 About

This repository was created to help **students** learn the **fundamentals of Python programming** in a simple and structured way.  
Each session introduces a new concept — from basic syntax to conditional statements — using **clear explanations** and **practical examples** that build confidence step by step.

> 🗣️ “Don’t memorize code — understand how it works.”  
> — A reminder to focus on logic, not just syntax.
